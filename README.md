# Capstone-Typing-Assistant-
Highschool capstone project: a wpm test and computer vision program that looks at user's fingering when used with colored stickers.

This project was created over the span of my 12th grade school year, I am now putting it on github. I put together a final presentation at the end of the school year as well as a live demonstration. This was the first time I did anything with computer vision.
